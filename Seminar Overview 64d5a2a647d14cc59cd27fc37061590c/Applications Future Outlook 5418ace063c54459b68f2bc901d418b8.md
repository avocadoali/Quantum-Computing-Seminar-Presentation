# Applications/Future Outlook

## It-security

- Secure multi-party computation
- Zero knowledge proofs (might use linear equations)

- Machine learning and big data analysis
    - general quantum algorithms for supervised and unsupervised machine learning ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0411))
        - high dimensional vectors using tensor products
    - applied support vector machine (link)
        - optimized for non-/linear binary classifier for supervised training
    

## Variations?

- Modifications/improvements/optimization
    - No ancilla bit required (not probabilistic) under specific requirements ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02200))
    - QRAM for preparing |b‚ü©  ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08675))
