# Intro QC/HHL

## Why do we want to use the HHL

- Quantum Algorithm that is able to solves linear equations very fast
    
    $$
    A \vec{x} = \vec{b}
    $$
    
- Importance of solving linear equations
    - Broad Applicability:
        - Linear systems of equations are a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering fields,
        - as optimization, machine learning, simulation, and cryptography. T
        - he HHL algorithm's motivation is to provide a quantum solution that can be applied to a wide range of applications,
        - Physics, Engineering
        - Modeling and analyzing data
        - optimization
        - machine learning, computer simulation, image processing
        - statistics
        - processing terabyte/petabytes of data for optimization or ml
        - â€¦

- Quantum Machine Learning:
    - growing field
    - quantum algorithmus for solving linear system
    - enables development in quantum machine learning
    - enables powerful algorithms for data analysis
    
- potentially revolutionizing these domains.
- even approximation with classical computers of linear equations of N unknowns needs at least N time steps
- HHL promises exponential speedup!!
