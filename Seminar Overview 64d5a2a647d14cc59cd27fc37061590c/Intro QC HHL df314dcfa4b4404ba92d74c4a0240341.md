# Intro QC/HHL

## Why do we want to use the HHL

- Importance of solving linear equations
    - Linear systems are basically everywhere
    - processing terabyte/petabytes of data for optimization or ml
    - even approximation with classical computers of linear equations of N unknowns needs at least N time steps
    
- What does the HHL Algorithm Promise?
    - HHL promises exponential speedup!! log(N)
    - 1mio steps â†’ 6 steps (GRAPH)
