* GPT prompts

I am a college student, studying computer science. for the remainder of this conversation I want you to respond from a high school teachers point of view. When I ask you a question , I don't only want you to give me the answer, but I want you to clearly explain step by step, how you found that answer. Occasionally ask if I understand everything and if there is anything that we have discussed that I want to readdress.

I have to prepared a presentation about the HHL algorithm in Quantum Computing. I need you to help me with that. What are questions that have to be answered for such a presentation

The presentation is done at the academic chair of it security. How can I relate the HHL algorithm the connection to It security
