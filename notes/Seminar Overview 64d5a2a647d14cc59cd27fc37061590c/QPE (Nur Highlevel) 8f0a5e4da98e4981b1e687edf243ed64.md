## What is Quantum Phase Estimation?

Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a quantum algorithm that estimates the phase of a quantum state. The phase of a quantum state is a complex number that determines the probability distribution of the state. 

QPE works by applying a series of controlled unitary operations to a quantum state, and measuring the state at each step. The measured values are then used to estimate the phase of the state. The number of measurements required by QPE depends on the desired accuracy of the phase estimate.

In summary, QPE is a powerful quantum algorithm used for phase estimation, and is a building block for many other quantum algorithms.
